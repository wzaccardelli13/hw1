    <h1>Zacca Spice Store - Welcome to our Online Store!</h1>

    <P>Shop our full inventory of spices from the convience of your home.</P>
    
    <p>Here are some helpful guidelines before you get shopping:</p>
    <o1>
        <li>Buy small quantities. Large budget packs seem cheaper, but it’s a false savings if you end up with stale ingredients that you need to throw away.</li>
        <li>Spices don’t have to be kept in the dark, but do avoid direct sunlight and store in a cool, dry part of the kitchen. Heat and light break down all-important oils, affect the flavor and also degrade the antioxidants.</li>
        <li>The easiest way to tell if a spice is still potent is to have a sniff. If it’s pleasant and pungent, it’s OK to use. </li>
        <li>The best way to buy spices is to get them whole, then grind them as needed—the flavor and aroma of whole spices tend to be more stable. You can use a mortar and pestle or a spice/coffee grinder for this.</li>
